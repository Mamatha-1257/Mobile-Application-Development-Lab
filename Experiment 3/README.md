Develop an application that shows names as a list and on selecting a name it should show the details of the candidate on the next screen with a "Back" button. If the screen is rotated to landscape mode (width greater than height), then the screen should show list on left fragment and details on right fragment instead of second screen with back button. Use Fragment transactions and Rotation event listener
